Centos 7 minimal box

Note, this is still in development/construction

I created a centos 7 minimal box. I could not find a box with kvm as the provider so I made one real quick.

The current box is built with release upstream centos release 1503-01 ( 7.1 )

1. manifest

  1. ssh key
    * ssh-keygen -P "" -f insecure-vagrant

Notes

1. still need to get the vagrant user and sudo stuff set up
